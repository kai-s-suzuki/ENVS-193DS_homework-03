Problem 1. Personal Data

I could calculate the mean caffeine consumed (mg) to compare how much caffeine is consumed between days with 0, 1, and 2 classes. Since I feel like I get more work done on days without classes and I have less commitments to prevent me from preparing or buying a caffeinated drink, it would make sense to compare means.
